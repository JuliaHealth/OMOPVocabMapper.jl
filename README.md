# OmopVocabMapper

OmopVocabMapper is a Julia-based library for mapping various medical vocabularies to the OMOP standard vocabulary. It provides functionalities to convert terminology codes from different sources, starting with ICD (International Classification of Diseases), to the corresponding OMOP concept IDs.

## Features

- Mapping ICD codes to OMOP concept IDs: The library currently supports the mapping of ICD codes to their respective concept IDs in the OMOP vocabulary.
- Reusability: We are actively working on expanding the functionality to support mapping of additional vocabularies like RXNORM, CPT, NDC, and more, making the library versatile and adaptable to different terminologies.
